Release 2

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
sqlite> SELECT * fROM users, reviews, businesses WHERE users.id = reviews.user_id AND businesses.id = reviews.business_id;
2|Ben|Martin|1|5|The car works great!|1|2|1|Tesla
3|Super|Man|2|4|Everything worked as expected.|2|3|2|DBC
3|Super|Man|3|3|Was average.|3|3|3|Walmart

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE users.id = reviews.user_id AND businesses.id = reviews.business_id;
Ben|Martin|Tesla|5|The car works great!
Super|Man|DBC|4|Everything worked as expected.
Super|Man|Walmart|3|Was average.

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE users.id = reviews.user_id AND businesses.id = reviews.business_id AND businesses.name = "Walmart";
Super|Man|Walmart|3|Was average.
Steve|Jobs|Walmart|2|Would not buy again.
