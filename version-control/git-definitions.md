# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to track and view of the the whole history of changes to a file, as well as any merges between versions, including who made the changes or merge. This is useful because it lets us see whats going on with the file, and to rollback any errors or mistakes made in a change. It also allows for many people to work on the same codebase, while allowing for new features to be merged into the master codebase without having to work directly on it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is when you split a out a project (using version control) to work on. You can use it to change and experiment with an existing codebase without risking the stable version, or to split out branches to add new features into the master codebase.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in the repository/project/branch. It is used when you want to document the changes into git/github/version control. A good commit message will explain (in present tense) the why and how of the change in a thorough, but concise way.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when attempting to merge, but some files/lines/code have conflicting changes.
