		<h1 class="font_change">Welcome</h1>
		<p>This is my quick and dirty page on dinosaurs. It's really not designed to have a lot of content, but more as an example of <em>HTML</em>.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, there is not going to be a lot of style on this page, but maybe someday we'll fix it up to look a bit nicer.</p>

		<h3 class="font_change">My Favorite Dinosaur</h3>
		<p>Ever since I saw Jurassic Park, one of my favorite dinosaurs is the velociraptor. The kind of funny thing is that the "velociraptors" in the movie and book are actually modeled after deinonychus, a slightly larger, related species found in Montana. Both belong to the family Dromaeosauridae, which includes several other raptor species.</p>

		<p>Fun facts about raptors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They were bipedal</li>
			<li>They had "the claw" that was featured in Jurassic Park</li>
			<li>They had long tails</li>
			<li>They ranged in size from 2 feet to over 20 feet in length</li>
			<li>They probably were covered in feathers</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>Another Site!</h3>
			<p>In this last section, I'm suppose to look at another site and their source code and summaries good/bad things about it. The topic is prone to lots of click bait, so I picked the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/dinosaurs/">American Museum of Natural History</a> page.</p>
			<p>There is a lot of source code I recognize with in the page, including some of the meta information and JavaScript. The page does not make use of tables, using <code>div</code> and <code>ul</code> to simulate them in CSS. Overall the page is well done and meets modern conventions.</p>
